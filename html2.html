    <p> Hi, my name is Sabrina Sturtevant, and I will graduate in December with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.
<br>
<br>
    My approach to art is to give myself plenty of time to come up with sketches and ideas for my projects. I try to work on it for little bits at a time, so I never get overwhelmed. I do my best to strike a balance between work and fun when I can.
